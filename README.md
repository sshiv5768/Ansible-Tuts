## What is configuration management ?

 Let's make it simple, "The process of maintaining the desired state of any application is called Configuration Management".

* In this user will write the desired state of the application.

* Scripts are declarative not procedural.

* The major purpose is to maintain desired state of the application.

* It has an important feature know as __idempotence__ (No matter how many time you will run the script result will be same).

* Configuration management tools:
  * Ansible
  
  * Chef
